            I'm planning to bake the chocolate cake for your birthday party. The recipe mentions "rich frosting" but doesn't specify what type. Could you clarify your preferences? For example:
            1. Would you prefer buttercream or cream cheese frosting?
            2. Do you want any specific flavor added to the frosting (vanilla, coffee, etc.)?
            3. Should I add any decorative toppings like sprinkles or fruit?
            4. Do you have any dietary restrictions I should be aware of?
